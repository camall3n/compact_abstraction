# Pytorch DQN Implementation
Implementation of DQN (Mnih 2015) in Pytorch. 
Uses Python 3.7, install minimal packages using 

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Make sure run.sh is executable (check with `ls -l`, if +x is in the permissions,
you're good). If not use `chmod +x run.sh`, to get it executable. 

Then use `./run.sh` to run the dqn on the specified environment.
